User Journey and Personas


I am taking the Coursera Google UX Design Certification course and
my prompt for the course-long project is 
"Design a mobile sales app for an animal shelter". 
For this post I have included the initial steps of the project which 
are: creating personas, user journeys and user mapping (both big picture and the closeup). 
The posts labeled "Wireframes" and "Low-Fidelity Prototype" are also 
based on this same project.
