Digital Art


I enjoy drawing using the Procreate app on an iPad. A lot of my art focuses
on landscapes and I focus on color schemes that envoke a sense of joy and
vibrancy. 


Mountains: I crafted these mountains with the intention of recreating the
sense wonder I felt when visiting Utah. The stunning 
landscapes, and majesty of nature left me feeling an incredible sense 
of awe and serenity.

City Scape: 
I created this cityscape drawing with the aim 
of capturing the intimidating yet enchangting essence of a busy 
city nightlife. I was inspired by the animated Spider-Man movies and 
the incredible work that went into crafting them. 
I also wants to capture the weight and pressure life can place on our
shoulders, as if you are alone in your struggles. 
The cityscape itself is a character, evoking a unique blend of energy and 
isolation that I find deeply compelling."
