ISACA Case Competition

I led a team through a month-long case competition for the 
Information Systems Audit and Control Association. 
During this month we analyzed an infrastructure 
remediation project and advised on any gaps, risks to the 
overall projects, and shortcomings in the published plan. 
You can view my team's youtube video and powerpoint deck below.
