Low-Fidelity Prototype

I am taking the Coursera Google UX Design Certification course and
my prompt for the course-long project is 
"Design a mobile sales app for an animal shelter". 
For this post I have included the first low fidelity prototype for this app, created in Figma. 
The posts labeled "User Journey and Personas" and "Wireframes" are also 
based on this same project.
